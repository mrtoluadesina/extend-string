# extendString

### Description
A mini prototype based project to extend the String class in Javascript. Using the POP, methods, procedures and instance attributes are added to the String class to support more string manipulation features.

### How will I complete this project?
- Use ES5 consistently throughout the project 
- Organise the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests
- Write tests to cover all the methods to be written, before development begins (TDD) 
- All the tests should fail, hopefully, for all the methods below
- Write the functions to account for all the methods below
- None of the methods below has arguments, the bracket contents indicate their return data types.
